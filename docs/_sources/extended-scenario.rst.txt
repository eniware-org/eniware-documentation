Extended Scenario: creating, building and deploying Documentation using Sphinx / Eclipse - GitHub - GitHub Pages / Read The Docs
================================================================================================================================

The source rst-files are created (or cloned) by using Eclipse. The building process is done locally using Sphinx - the created static pages can be viewed and tested locally (and eventually hosted on a random site). The source files are stored as a project in GitHub repository and the static web pages - in special docs folder in the same repository. The content of this docs folder is hosted by using GitHub Pages which is a static site hosting service. At the same time, the source rst-files are built and hosted automatized by the Read The Docs service as in the :ref:`Basic Scenario <basic>`.
